# Learn-Astropy-Website
A website for the Astropy Learn ecosystem which will consolidate Astropy documentation, Astropy tutorials, guides and examples in a single dynamically searchable web page.

The website will have features like filters, searchable categories, tags, color codes to separate different learning material types. All these will result in a intuitive user interface and will provide easy access to all the features and functionalities provided by Astropy packages.

This is first draft of my GSoC 2018 project.
